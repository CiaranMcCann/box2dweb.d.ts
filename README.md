box2d2web.d.ts
===========

This is a typescript definitions file for box2dweb.js.

There are a few ports of box2d to javascript, I have specifically picked box2dweb.js since it has zero dependencies and can be linked to your project via a single file.

The actual definitions are layed out over the original box2d directory structure, but you can reference everything by only including the box2dweb.d.ts in the root folder.
